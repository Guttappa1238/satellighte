# About The Satellighte

**Satellighte** is an image classification library  that consist state-of-the-art deep learning methods. It is a combination of the words **'Satellite'** and **'Light'**, and its purpose is to establish a light structure to classify satellite images, but to obtain robust results.

> **Satellite image classification** is the most significant technique used in remote sensing for the computerized study and pattern recognition of satellite information, which is based on diversity structures of the image that involve rigorous validation of the training samples depending on the used classification algorithm.
